/*Write a console program which allows a user to search a library catalog and check out books.
Your solution must include some kind of a book class with a title, author, status, and due date if checked out.
Status should be On Shelf or Checked Out (or other statuses you can imagine). 
12 items minimum; All stored in a list.
Allow the user to:
Display the entire list of books.  Format it nicely.
Search for a book by author.
Search for a book by title keyword.
Select a book from the list to check out.
If it’s already checked out, let them know.
If not, check it out to them and set the due date to 2 weeks from today.
Return a book.  (You can decide how that looks/what questions it asks.)

Optional enhancements:
(Moderate)When the user quits, save the current library book list (including due dates and statuses) to the text file so the next time the program runs, it remembers.
